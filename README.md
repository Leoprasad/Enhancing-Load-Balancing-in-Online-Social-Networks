# Enhancing-Load-Balancing-in-Online-Social-Networks
Description:
This paper proposes significant enhancements to 
the Distributed Power Greedy Server (DPGS) algorithm, 
originally designed for optimizing client-server assignments 
in online social network applications. Our proposal
introduces a more sophisticated greedy phase, an adaptive 
perturbation mechanism, and a complex objective function 
to better balance load distribution among servers. The 
enhanced greedy phase incorporates a prioritization 
strategy for user reassignments, which, though increasing 
computational overhead, allows for more strategic decisionmaking. This phase now involves sorting and prioritizing 
users based on specific criteria, moving beyond the simpler 
approach of the original algorithm. Additionally, we have 
introduced an adaptive perturbation phase that 
dynamically adjusts perturbation probabilities. This 
adaptive approach, while adding to the run time at some 
levels, is designed to converge toward optimal solutions 
more efficiently. Finally, the complexity of the objective 
function has been increased to calculate the sum of squared 
loads per server.
